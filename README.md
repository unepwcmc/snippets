# snippets

~~Repository of general snippets for improved productivity. Sorted by language and also area of use (terminal commands, dotfiles/aliases, text editor code)~~


No longer used - there is a separate snippets repo for the GIS hub (https://github.com/unepwcmc/scripts) and a separate section in the Informatics wiki for the Informatics team.
